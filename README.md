# Recipe Book

## An application that organizes and stores all your recipes

My project will be a recipe book application that organizes and stores
all the recipes added to it. This way, users can easily revisit some of 
their old recreations by just **searching up the title of the recipe without 
having to physically rummage through a book.** I felt inspired to work on this
because I will be *living by myself* soon, and I have to learn how to cook.
This application will save me a lot of time, being easy to use and time efficent.


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to create and write my own recipes to add to my recipe book
- As a user, I want to search or view a list of the current recipes in my book
- As a user, I want to be able to select a specific recipe in the list to read and/or edit
- As a user, I want to sort the recipes by categories. For instance, apple pie will be organized in the baking category.
