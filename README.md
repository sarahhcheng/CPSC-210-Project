# Recipe Book Application


## An application that organizes and stores all your recipes

My project will be a recipe book application that organizes and stores
all the recipes added to it. This way, users can easily revisit some of 
their old recreations by just **searching up the title of the recipe without 
having to physically rummage through a book.** I felt inspired to work on this
because I will be *living by myself* soon, and I have to learn how to cook.
This application will save me a lot of time, being easy to use and time efficient.


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to create and write my own recipes to add to my recipe book
- As a user, I want to search or view a list of the current recipes in my book
- As a user, I want to be able to select a specific recipe in the list to read and/or edit
- As a user, I want to sort the recipes by categories. For instance, apple pie will be organized in the baking category.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a random recipe from my list
- As a user, I want to be able to save the entire creation of my recipe book with all my recipes
- As a user, I want the ability to reload my recipe book from where I last left off

## Instructions for Grader
- If you want to add multiple recipes to the recipe book, first enter the name of the recipe,
the duration and the amount of people it serves and then click the + button for it to display on the 
side panel
- If you want to add multiple ingredients to a recipe, fill in the ingredients, quantity
and unit input fields and then click the + Ingredient button
- If you want to add multiple instructions to a recipe, fill in the instructions input 
field and then click the + Instructions button
- You can locate my visual component at the top of the screen next to the title: My Recipe Book
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save button
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load recipe button

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time, I would refactor my code so that the buttons I  made at the bottom would be more organized. 
Right now, using my application is not that intuitive because of the way the buttons are set up. For instance, 
the ingredients and instructions are added separately from the recipe name, duration and the number of people 
it serves. In order to do make this change, I would either make three new JPanels within my bottom panel for the
general recipe input fields and buttons, ingredient info and instructions info, or I would use a JSeparator to do that.
This way, my application will be very intuitive to use for anyone without having to open my README file.
